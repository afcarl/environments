### Design Overview

An motor order is a dictionary of channels with given values

```python
order = {'joint1': 0.5, 'joint2': 1.0, 'speed': 10.0}
```

An environmental feedback is a list of dictionaries, with keys as sensory channels, and values as activation strength of each channel. Dictionnary represent arbitrary grouping of channels (examples x, y and z positions for an object). The channels are not apriori known in advance.

```python
feedback = [{'toy_x': 34.2, 'toy_y': 25.1}, {'light_intensity': 303.7}]
```

An environment execute motor orders.

```python
class Environment(object):

    def execute(self, order):
        return feedback
```
